# 60 Days of Rust ðŸ¦€
I'm taking on a 60-day challenge to learn Rust by building a series of projects. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Rust's unique featuresâ€”ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, and moreâ€”by creating real-world applications from scratch.

### Projects
Day 1+: [Kanban App](https://github.com/danielwangai/rust-in-60-days/tree/main/kanban) â€“ A simple task management app to practice Rust basics, data structures, and CLI.

More projects will follow as I continue exploring Rust.

Why This Challenge?
To master Rust through practical coding, not just theory.
To document my progress and share what I learn along the way.
To create a portfolio of Rust projects.
Stay tuned for upcoming projects! ðŸš€
